>Policy scholars explain how hard it is to elevate these types of issues
to the top of the decision-making agenda (Baumgartner and Jones 1993;
Birkland 2006). Organization theorists offer helpful insights with regard to creating cultures that may enhance and sustain resilience (LaPorte 2007;
Schulman and Roe 2007).[Comfort, Boin, Demchak, 2010]

> A critical approach that distinguishes this book from other discussions
of resilience is its inquiry into sociotechnical systems. The literature on
social cognition (Hermann et al. 2007), cognitive anthropology (Hutchins
1995), and sociotechnical systems (Coakes, Willis, and Clark 2002) care-
fully examines what humans do and how they do it in relation to the tech-
nical systems they operate. In this perspective, the transition from percep-
tion to action at individual, group, organizational, and systemic scales of
operation is critical to understanding the dynamics of resilience. Develop-
ing metrics of resilience in actual environments exposed to risk represents
a critical task that is only beginning.
The interaction between increasingly advanced technical systems and
the human organizations that design, build, operate, and manage them has
been studied by researchers at the Tavistock Institute for Social Research
since it opened in 1946 (Trist, Emery, and Murray 1997). The impact of
technology on social organizations is, of course, continually unfolding
(Coakes, Willis, and Lloyd-Jones 2000). The modern-day exponential in-
crease in the use of information technology across the world is presenting
ever more complex and surprising dynamics in social action and organi-
zational performance (Coakes, Willis, and Clarke 2002). Such changing
conditions require considerable integrative efforts to understand the dual
nature of these technologies. They can be harnessed to effective decision
support in large-scale events, but they also impose new or enhanced con-
straints on organizational action.[Comfort, Boin, Demchak, 2010]

Passage d'un paradigme qui voyait dans l'homme un élément non fiable susceptible de mettre en danger un système bien rodé à une prise de conscience de sa capacité d'adaptation

> p.4 When researchers in the early 1980s began to re-examine human
error and collect data on how complex systems had failed, it soon
became apparent that people actually provided a positive contribution
to safety through their ability to adapt to changes, gaps in system
design, and unplanned for situations.

> p.6 Resilience engineering is a paradigm for safety management that
focuses on how to help people cope with complexity under pressure to
achieve success.

Aspects nécessaires: (p.5)

* continually revise their approach to work in an effort to remain sensitive to the possibility for failure.
* ‘improvements’ and changes create new paths to failure
* missing the side effects of change is the most common form of failure for organisations and individuals
* a culture of safety depends on remaining dynamically engaged in new assessments and avoiding stale, narrow, or static representations of the changing paths
* p.6 analyse, measure and monitor the resilience of organisations in
their operating environment.
* p.6 analyse, measure and monitor the resilience of organisations in
their operating environment.
* p.6 model and predict the short- and long-term effects of change
and line management decisions on resilience and therefore on risk.
