Aspects de la résilience:
  * Dealing with the actual
  * dealing with the critical
  * dealing with the potential


# Définition de la résilience

Des outils permettent d'acquérir de l'expérience à partir des évènements passés (Incident reporting). Effet de constriction qui oblige à regarder le futur avec les éléments du passé

> researchers – are prone to the effects of hindsight, as pointed out by Fischhoff (1975). It is practically a characteristic of human nature – and an inescapable one at that – to try to make sense
of what has happened, to try to make the perceived world comprehensible. We are consequently constrained to look at the future in the light of the past.
HOLLNAGEL, WOODS 2006, p.2

> the tried and trusted approaches are only changed when they fail and then usually by adding one more factor or element to account for the unexplained variability.
> p.3 the thesis that leaps out from these results is that failure, as
individual failure or performance failure on the system level, represents
the temporary inability to cope effectively with complexity.

Passage d'un paradigme qui voyait dans l'homme un élément non fiable susceptible de mettre en danger un système bien rodé à une prise de conscience de sa capacité d'adaptation

> p.4 When researchers in the early 1980s began to re-examine human
error and collect data on how complex systems had failed, it soon
became apparent that people actually provided a positive contribution
to safety through their ability to adapt to changes, gaps in system
design, and unplanned for situations.

> p.6 Resilience engineering is a paradigm for safety management that
focuses on how to help people cope with complexity under pressure to
achieve success.

Aspects nécessaires: (p.5)

* continually revise their approach to work in an effort to remain sensitive to the possibility for failure.
* ‘improvements’ and changes create new paths to failure
* missing the side effects of change is the most common form of failure for organisations and individuals
* a culture of safety depends on remaining dynamically engaged in new assessments and avoiding stale, narrow, or static representations of the changing paths
* p.6 analyse, measure and monitor the resilience of organisations in
their operating environment.
* p.6 analyse, measure and monitor the resilience of organisations in
their operating environment.
* p.6 model and predict the short- and long-term effects of change
and line management decisions on resilience and therefore on risk.

Lorsqu'on s'éloigne du déterminisme positiviste des sciences dures on peut apercevoir une autre vision de la résilience. Géographie, psychologie
Approche différente à l'erreur: plutôt que de l'éviter, on apprend à gérer ses conséquences.
