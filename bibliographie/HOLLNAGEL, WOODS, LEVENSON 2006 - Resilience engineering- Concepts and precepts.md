p. 3
The thesis that leaps out from these results is that failure, as
individual failure or performance failure on the system level, represents
the temporary inability to cope effectively with complexity. Success
belongs to organisations, groups and individuals who are resilient in the
sense that they recognise, adapt to and absorb variations, changes,
disturbances, disruptions, and surprises – especially disruptions that fall
outside of the set of disturbances the system is designed to handle
[...]
This book marks the maturation of a new approach to safety
management. In a world of finite resources, of irreducible uncertainty,
and of multiple conflicting goals, safety is created through proactive
resilient processes rather than through reactive barriers and defences.
The chapters in this book explore different facets of resilience as the

ability of systems to anticipate and adapt to the potential for surprise and failure.
[...]
In other words, in the ‘error counting’ paradigm, work on safety comprised protecting the system from unreliable, erratic, and limited human components (or, more clearly, protecting the people at the blunt end – in their roles as managers, regulators and consumers of systems – from unreliable ‘other’ people at the sharp end – who operate and maintain those systems).

people actually provided a positive contribution to safety through their ability to adapt to changes, gaps in system design, and unplanned for situations
[...]
failures represented breakdowns in adaptations directed at
coping with complexity while success was usually obtained as people learned and adapted to create safety in a world fraught with hazards, trade-offs, and multiple goals

* How workers and organisations continually revise their approach to work in an effort to remain sensitive to the possibility for failure.
* How distant observers of work, and the workers themselves, are only partially aware of the current potential for failure.
* How ‘improvements’ and changes create new paths to failure and new demands on workers, despite or because of new capabilities.
* How the strategies for coping with these potential paths can be either strong and resilient or weak and mistaken.
* How missing the side effects of change is the most common form of failure for organisations and individuals.
* How a culture of safety depends on remaining dynamically engaged in new assessments and avoiding stale, narrow, or static representations of the changing paths (revising or reframing the understanding of paths toward failure over time).
* How overconfident people can be that they have already
anticipated the types and mechanisms of failure, and that the strategies they have devised are effective and will remain so.
* How continual effort after success in a world of changing pressures and hazards is fundamental to creating safety.

Resilience engineering is a paradigm for safety management that focuses on how to help people cope with complexity under pressure to achieve success.

[Resilience Engineering steps]
* to analyse, measure and monitor the resilience of organisations in their operating environment.
* to improve an organisation’s resilience vis-à-vis the environment.
* to model and predict the short- and long-term effects of change and line management decisions on resilience and therefore on risk.

Analyses of successes, incidents, and breakdowns reveal the normal sources of resilience that allow systems to produce success when failure threatens.
These events and other measures indicate the level and kinds of brittleness/resilience the system in question exhibits. Such indicators will allow organisations to develop the mechanisms to create foresight, to recognise, anticipate, and defend against paths to failure that arise as organisations and technology change.
